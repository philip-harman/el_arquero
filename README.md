# A mighty archpy game!

### Description

El arquero is a mini game made with Python using `pygame`, `numpy` and `math`libraries. In this game, an archer shoots an arrow on the left side of the screen and there is a target randomly located according to the level. The player's objective is to shoot arrows at the target but for this he needs to calibrate the speed and angle of the shot taking into account the intensity of the wind which appears in the lower left part of the screen.

The game consists of 5 levels where the difficulty will be increased by adding obstacles also the wind speed will change.
